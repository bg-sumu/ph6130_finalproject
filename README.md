This project delves into the realm of statistical analysis, particularly focusing on a frequentist approach, and explores its significance in data science. Statistical analysis is fundamental in drawing meaningful insights from data, understanding patterns, trends, and relationships within datasets, and making informed decisions. Key concepts such as outliers, interquartile range (IQR), hypothesis testing, and inferential statistics are elucidated. The American Community Survey (ACS) 5-Year Documentation from the U.S. Census Reports serves as the primary data source, offering a comprehensive overview of socio-economic factors across different states in the USA.

In addition to basic statistical analysis, the project explores inferential statistics techniques including hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and the Chi-Squared Test of Independence. References to various statistical resources and tutorials are made throughout to deepen understanding. By focusing on USA real estate trends, the project aims to demonstrate practical applications of statistical analysis and its significance in data-driven decision-making.
