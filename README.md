This project delves into the realm of sta-
tistical analysis, particularly focusing on a frequentist

approach, and explores its significance in data science.
Statistical analysis is fundamental in drawing meaningful
insights from data, understanding patterns, trends, and

relationships within datasets, and making informed deci-
sions. Key concepts such as outliers, interquartile range

(IQR), hypothesis testing, and inferential statistics are
elucidated. The American Community Survey (ACS) 5-
Year Documentation from the U.S. Census Reports serves
as the primary data source, offering a comprehensive
overview of socio-economic factors across different states
in the USA.
In addition to basic statistical analysis, the project

explores inferential statistics techniques including hypoth-
esis testing, confidence intervals, and the Chi-Squared

Test of Independence. References to various statistical
resources and tutorials are made throughout to deepen
understanding. By focusing on USA real estate trends,
the project aims to demonstrate practical applications
of statistical analysis and its significance in data-driven
decision-making.
